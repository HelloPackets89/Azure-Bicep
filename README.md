# Azure-Bicep

The purpose of this Repo is to fulfil two functions:

1. A store for my BICEP scripts and custom extensions
2. A playground for me to get familiarity with Github and VS code


For educational reasons, all scripts are written by hand using VScode.
BICEP scripts come together by reading ARM templates created from the Azure Portal. And many many failed deployments. 
Powershell scripts come together via combination of work shopping with ChatGPT and reading MS documentation. And lots of red text.

Expect mistakes and don't use any of this for production environments!
